# Melodies-of-Life
<pre>
 Alone and quite alone 
Standing on the sea beach
 And looking at the sun 
Setting down in the western horizon.
 I suddenly got back to my life 
fallen behind, 
Recollecting the sorrows and joys
 all around. 
The sun with its last rays 
Sinking down the vast water 
of the ocean
 With the aspiration of rising
 the next morning again. 
But there's a gulf of difference 
Between the two lives.
 My life and deeds end here 
with no hope to flash in future.
 I repent and profoundly repent 
what inappropriate deeds
 I committed in the past
 For passion and misappropriation.
 In front of me I see nothing 
blessings from the air
 that can console me fair. 
For heaven only knows 
what is in store in my lot
 In the coming years.
